    1. Write a function that returns a boolean indicating whether or not a string is a palindrome.
     
    2. Write a function that takes array of strings as an argument and returns a new array that contains the same items as the original array, but in the following
        order: first, all strings that start with a digit (0-9), sorted in descendent
        order by their numeric value, then all strings that start with anything except
        the capital letter "P" in alphabetical order, and then all strings that start
        with the "P" in the order of the string length.
        
        // should print ['432', '123.4', '001', 'Alpha', 'Beta', 'Gamma', 'Pit', 'Peter', 'Palindrome']
